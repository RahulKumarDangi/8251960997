Retail_sales_prediction_capstone_project

BUSINESS PROBLEM :- Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store.
managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by
many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands
of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

SOLUTION STRATEGY :-  My strategy to solve this challenge was:
Step 01: Data Description: Use statistics metrics to identify data distributions.

Step 02: Feature Engineering: Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

Step 04: Feature Selection: Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.

Step 05: Machine Learning Modelling: Machine Learning model training.

Step 06: Hyperparameter Fine Tunning: hoose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step.

Step 07: Convert Model Performance to Business Values: Convert the performance of the Machine Learning model into a business result.

OVERVIEW :- This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast sales for retail stores based on historical
sales data and store attributes. The predictive model will enable store managers to make informed decisions
regarding inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies, ultimately leading to improved operational efficiency and business performance.

DATASET :-
Rossman.csv : '/content/drive/MyDrive/Rossmann Stores Data (1).csv'
Store.csv : '/content/drive/MyDrive/store (1).csv' 
The dataset used for this project contains various features including store information, temporal data, promotional activities, and external factors like holidays and school holidays. 
 It is provided in a CSV format and can be found in the data directory. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing
values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features before being used for model development.

CONCLUSION :-
In conclusion, the implementation of the Random Forest Classifier, aided by hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV, yielded significant improvements in predictive accuracy.
Leveraging the model's interpretability using feature importance analysis tools like SHAP or ELI5 provided valuable insights into the most influential features driving predictions. This enhanced understanding enables informed decision-making for businesses, leading to more
effective strategies and optimized outcomes.
